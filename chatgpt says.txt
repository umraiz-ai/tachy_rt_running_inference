chatgpt says it is has kernel 5.4
It also says that bootloader are backward compatible. 
that means the latest bootloader can run 5.4 kernel ubuntu 20.04
but it did not work . 
since bootloader was of latest version.
and the firmware camw with ubuntu 20.04 was old.
what chatgpt suggested is to change some files like ,elf .bin and .dat files.
let us see what happens.
it worked and OS was booted successfully
I was also able to run the example successfully


Path to the exact image
