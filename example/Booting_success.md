umraiz-ai: which folder are you in currently ?

GitHub Copilot: You are currently in the /home/admin/raspberrypi_contilab folder.

umraiz-ai: ok read the eng_READ.md file and let me know what you learnt ?

GitHub Copilot: Here’s what I learned from the eng_READ.md file:

- The document explains how to use the Tachy-Runtime API to control a Tachy Device.
- The API functions are grouped into five categories: system, sensor, debug, inference, and example functions.
- Installation steps include installing a Python wheel and running an install script with sudo.
- You must set the TACHY_INTERFACE environment variable (e.g., spi:host) to communicate with the device.
- The document provides command-line examples for:
  - System functions (getting device status, booting, saving models)
  - Sensor functions (dumping sensor images, enabling sensors)
  - Debug functions (evaluating throughput and latency)
- The inference functions section is marked as TODO.
- Example applications are available in the example directory.

Let me know if you want details on any specific section or command.

umraiz-ai: let us get started. 
what is the first step ?

GitHub Copilot: The first step is to install the Tachy-Runtime API for Python.  
You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

````bash
pip install common/whl/tachy_rt-3.2.0-py3-none-any.whl
````

This will install the required Python package for interacting with the Tachy Device.

umraiz-ai: what is next ?

GitHub Copilot: The next step is to run the install script to complete the setup.  
Use the following command in your terminal (sudo permission is required):

````bash
sudo ./bin/install.sh
````

This will copy the execution script to the /bin directory and finish the installation process.

umraiz-ai: (pvenv) root@raspberrypi:/home/admin/raspberrypi_contilab# sudo ./bin/install.sh
sudo: ./bin/install.sh: command not found

GitHub Copilot: The error `sudo: ./bin/install.sh: command not found` means that the `install.sh` script does not exist in the `./bin` directory or is not executable.

**Next steps:**

1. **Check if the script exists:**
   ```bash
   ls -l ./bin/install.sh
   ```

2. **If it exists but is not executable, make it executable:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x ./bin/install.sh
   ```

3. **If it does not exist, check if the `bin` directory exists and contains any install script:**
   ```bash
   ls ./bin
   ```

Let me know the output of these commands so I can guide you further.

umraiz-ai: maybe this script is in some other directory. how to check that ?

GitHub Copilot: To check if the `install.sh` script exists elsewhere in your project, you can search for it using the `find` command from your project root:

````bash
find . -name install.sh
````

This will list all locations of `install.sh` in your current directory tree.  
If you find it, you can run it using its full path.

umraiz-ai: (pvenv) root@raspberrypi:/home/admin/raspberrypi_contilab# find . -name install.sh
./inference/bin/install.sh

GitHub Copilot: The `install.sh` script is located at install.sh.

To run it, use the following command from your project root:

````bash
sudo ./inference/bin/install.sh
````

This should execute the install script as described in the documentation.

umraiz-ai: (pvenv) root@raspberrypi:/home/admin/raspberrypi_contilab# sudo ./inference/bin/install.sh
Copy scripts to /bin ...
cp: cannot stat 'debug/*': No such file or directory
cp: cannot stat 'sensor/*': No such file or directory
cp: cannot stat 'system/*': No such file or directory

GitHub Copilot: The error messages:

```
cp: cannot stat 'debug/*': No such file or directory
cp: cannot stat 'sensor/*': No such file or directory
cp: cannot stat 'system/*': No such file or directory
```

mean that the install script is trying to copy files from the `debug`, `sensor`, and `system` directories, but these directories do not exist in your current path.

**What you should do next:**

1. **Check if these directories exist** in inference:
   ```bash
   ls /home/admin/raspberrypi_contilab/inference/
   ```

2. **If they do not exist**, you may be missing required files or directories.  
   - Check the documentation or source where you got this project to see if there are additional files to download or clone.
   - If you have a backup or another source, copy the missing directories (`debug`, `sensor`, `system`) into inference.

3. **If they exist elsewhere**, move or copy them into the inference directory.

Let me know the output of the `ls /home/admin/raspberrypi_contilab/inference/` command, and I can guide you further.

umraiz-ai: (pvenv) root@raspberrypi:/home/admin/raspberrypi_contilab# ls /home/admin/raspberrypi_contilab/inference/
bin  common  debug  eng_READ.md  example  README.md  sensor  system

GitHub Copilot: Great, the `debug`, `sensor`, and `system` directories do exist in inference.

The earlier error likely happened because you ran the install script from the project root, but the script expects to be run from within the inference directory (so it can find `debug/*`, `sensor/*`, and `system/*`).

**To fix this:**

1. Change to the inference directory:
   ````bash
   cd /home/admin/raspberrypi_contilab/inference
   ````

2. Run the install script from there:
   ````bash
   sudo ./bin/install.sh
   ````

This should allow the script to find the required directories and complete the installation.

umraiz-ai: I got this 
(pvenv) root@raspberrypi:/home/admin/raspberrypi_contilab/inference# sudo ./bin/install.sh
Copy scripts to /bin ...

GitHub Copilot: That output means the install script ran successfully this time and copied the necessary scripts to bin.  
You have completed the installation step.

**Next steps:**

1. **Set the interface environment variable** (as shown in the documentation):
   ````bash
   export TACHY_INTERFACE=spi:host
   ````

2. You can now use the provided commands, such as `trt_get_device_status`, to interact with your Tachy Device.

Let me know if you want to try a specific function or need help with the next command!

OverflowError: Python integer -1 out of bounds for uint32

GitHub Copilot: The error message:

```
OverflowError: Python integer -1 out of bounds for uint32
```

means that the code is trying to write the value `-1` into a NumPy array of type `uint32` (unsigned 32-bit integer), which cannot represent negative numbers.

### Why this happens
- `np.uint32` can only store values from 0 to 4,294,967,295.
- Assigning `-1` to a `uint32` array causes an overflow error in recent NumPy versions.

### How to fix
The code should use a valid unsigned integer value. If `-1` is meant to represent "all bits set" (common in C/C++), use `0xFFFFFFFF` for `uint32`.

#### Example fix:
Find the line (in sender.py, line 351):

````python
spi.spi_write(INTERFACE_SPI_READER_HEADER, np.array([-1], np.uint32))
````

Change it to:

````python
spi.spi_write(INTERFACE_SPI_READER_HEADER, np.array([0xFFFFFFFF], np.uint32))
````

---

**Note:**  
Since this is in a package installed in your virtual environment, you will need to edit the installed file directly or contact the package maintainer for a fix.

Would you like instructions on how to edit this file directly?

umraiz-ai: can i directly change it save hen run ?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, you can directly change the installed Python file, save it, and then run your command again.

**Steps:**

1. Open the file for editing:
   ```
   /home/admin/raspberrypi_contilab/pvenv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/tachy_rt/core/sender.py
   ```

2. Find this line (around line 351):
   ````python
   spi.spi_write(INTERFACE_SPI_READER_HEADER, np.array([-1], np.uint32))
   ````

3. Change it to:
   ````python
   spi.spi_write(INTERFACE_SPI_READER_HEADER, np.array([0xFFFFFFFF], np.uint32))
   ````

4. Save the file.

5. Run your command again.

**Note:**  
Directly editing installed packages is fine for quick fixes, but if you update or reinstall the package, your change will be lost. For a permanent fix, notify the package maintainer.

umraiz-ai: I tried to change it in the vscode through SSH but it says unable to write it. maybe we need sudo for this ?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, you need elevated (sudo) permissions to edit files inside your virtual environment’s `site-packages` directory, since it is owned by root (because you installed the package with sudo).

**To edit with sudo:**

1. Open a terminal.
2. Use a command-line editor with sudo, for example:
   ````bash
   sudo nano /home/admin/raspberrypi_contilab/pvenv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/tachy_rt/core/sender.py
   ````
3. Make your change:
   ```python
   spi.spi_write(INTERFACE_SPI_READER_HEADER, np.array([0xFFFFFFFF], np.uint32))
   ```
4. Save and exit (`Ctrl+O`, `Enter`, then `Ctrl+X` in nano).

**Alternatively:**  
You can use VS Code’s “Remote - SSH” extension with sudo, but you’ll need to open the file in a terminal-based editor as above, since VS Code’s GUI editor does not support sudo directly.

Let me know if you need step-by-step help with nano or another editor!

TabError: inconsistent use of tabs and spaces in indentation

GitHub Copilot: The error:

```
TabError: inconsistent use of tabs and spaces in indentation
```

means that the line you edited (or uncommented) in sender.py mixes tabs and spaces for indentation, which Python does not allow.

### How to fix

1. **Find the problematic section** (around line 352 in `_spi_write`).
2. **Make sure all indentation uses spaces only** (recommended: 4 spaces per indent level).

Here’s how the fixed section should look (replace the commented-out line with the correct indentation):

````python
        ''' 4-2) reset addr '''
        spi.spi_write(INTERFACE_SPI_READER_HEADER, np.array([0xFFFFFFFF], np.uint32))
````
// filepath: sender.py

**Tip:**  
- In VS Code, you can select the code and use `Shift+Tab` or `Tab` to adjust indentation.
- You can also convert all tabs to spaces from the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Convert Indentation to Spaces").

After fixing, save the file and try running your command again.

umraiz-ai: how many indenteations in total from the extreme left ?

GitHub Copilot: In the provided `_spi_write` function, the code inside the main for-loop (e.g., the section with `spi.spi_write(addr, data[stt:end])`) is **2 indentation levels** from the extreme left.

Here’s the breakdown:
- Level 0: Function definition (`def _spi_write...`)
- Level 1: Main body of the function (e.g., `for i in progressbar...`)
- Level 2: Inside the for-loop and inner blocks (e.g., `while True:`, `if`, and the code you want to edit)

So, lines like:
```python
spi.spi_write(INTERFACE_SPI_READER_HEADER, np.array([0xFFFFFFFF], np.uint32))
```
should be indented with **8 spaces** (2 levels × 4 spaces per level) from the extreme left.

umraiz-ai: how to open this file in vs code in sudo mode ?

GitHub Copilot: VS Code does not natively support opening files in sudo mode through its GUI. However, you can use the terminal inside VS Code to edit the file with sudo permissions using a terminal-based editor like `nano` or `vim`.

**Here’s how:**

1. Open the integrated terminal in VS Code (`Ctrl+`` or from the menu: Terminal → New Terminal).
2. Run the following command to open the file with `nano` as root:
   ````bash
   sudo nano /home/admin/raspberrypi_contilab/pvenv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/tachy_rt/core/sender.py
   ````
3. Make your changes, then save (`Ctrl+O`, `Enter`) and exit (`Ctrl+X`).

**Alternatively:**  
If you want to use the VS Code GUI editor with sudo, you can launch a new VS Code window as root from a terminal (not recommended for security reasons):

````bash
sudo code .
````

But this is generally discouraged. The terminal method above is safer and preferred.

TabError: inconsistent use of tabs and spaces in indentation

GitHub Copilot: To fix the `TabError: inconsistent use of tabs and spaces in indentation`, you need to ensure that the entire file sender.py uses only spaces (not tabs) for indentation, or vice versa, but not both.

**Here’s how to fix it:**

1. **Open the file in a terminal editor with sudo:**
   ````bash
   sudo nano /home/admin/raspberrypi_contilab/pvenv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/tachy_rt/core/sender.py
   ````

2. **Go to the line with the error** (around line 316 or 352, depending on your edits):
   ```python
   spi.spi_write(INTERFACE_SPI_READER_HEADER, np.array([0xFFFFFFFF], np.uint32))
   ```

3. **Make sure the indentation matches the rest of the function.**  
   For Python, use 4 spaces per indentation level.  
   For example, if this line is inside a loop or function, it should look like this:
   ```python
        spi.spi_write(INTERFACE_SPI_READER_HEADER, np.array([0xFFFFFFFF], np.uint32))
   ```
   (8 spaces from the left if it's two levels deep.)

4. **Remove any tabs** and replace them with spaces.  
   In nano, you can move the cursor to the start of the line and manually delete and re-add spaces.

5. **Save and exit** (`Ctrl+O`, `Enter`, then `Ctrl+X`).

6. **Try running your command again.**

---

**Tip:**  
You can also convert all tabs to spaces in VS Code:
- Open the file in VS Code.
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` and type `Convert Indentation to Spaces`.
- Save the file, then copy it back with sudo if needed.

Let me know if you need the exact indentation for a specific block!

umraiz-ai: let us reinstall this package. I wam fedup with the changes. 

GitHub Copilot: To reinstall the `tachy_rt` package cleanly, follow these steps:

1. **Uninstall the current package:**
   ````bash
   pip uninstall tachy_rt
   ````

2. **Reinstall the package using the provided wheel file:**
   ````bash
   pip install common/whl/tachy_rt-3.2.0-py3-none-any.whl
   ````

3. **Run the install script again (from the correct directory):**
   ````bash
   cd inference
   sudo ./bin/install.sh
   ````

This will restore the original package files and setup.  
Let me know if you encounter any issues during reinstallation!

umraiz-ai: what is next 

GitHub Copilot: After reinstalling the package and running the install script, the next step is to **set the interface environment variable** so your system knows how to communicate with the Tachy Device.

Run this command in your terminal:

````bash
export TACHY_INTERFACE=spi:host
````

After setting this, you can start using the provided commands, such as checking the device status:

````bash
trt_get_device_status
````

OverflowError: Python integer -1 out of bounds for uint32

GitHub Copilot: The error:

```
OverflowError: Python integer -1 out of bounds for uint32
```

happens because `np.uint32` cannot represent negative numbers like `-1`.

**Solution:**  
You need to change the code in sender.py at the line:

```python
spi.spi_write(INTERFACE_SPI_READER_HEADER, np.array([-1], np.uint32))
```

to:

```python
spi.spi_write(INTERFACE_SPI_READER_HEADER, np.array([0xFFFFFFFF], np.uint32))
```

**Why?**  
`0xFFFFFFFF` is the unsigned 32-bit representation of all bits set (which is often what `-1` means in C/C++ code).

**How to do it:**
1. Open the file with sudo (since it's in your venv):
   ```bash
   sudo nano /home/admin/raspberrypi_contilab/pvenv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/tachy_rt/core/sender.py
   ```
2. Find the line with `np.array([-1], np.uint32)` and replace `-1` with `0xFFFFFFFF`.
3. Save and exit (`Ctrl+O`, `Enter`, then `Ctrl+X`).
4. Run your command again.

umraiz-ai: what the other commands represent ?

GitHub Copilot: Here’s what the other commands in the documentation represent:

---

### **System Functions**
- **trt_get_device_status**  
  Checks and displays the current status of the Tachy Device.

- **trt_boot_device**  
  Boots the device using HostSPI.  
  `--path` specifies the firmware path, `--upload` determines if the firmware should be uploaded.

- **trt_save_model**  
  Saves a compiled model to the device.  
  Options:  
  - `--name`: Model name  
  - `--model`: Path to the model file  
  - `--storage`: Where to store (memory or nor)  
  - `--overwrite`: Overwrite if exists

---

### **Sensor Functions**
- **trt_dump_sensor**

qt.qpa.xcb: could not connect to display 
qt.qpa.plugin: Could not load the Qt platform plugin "xcb" in "/home/admin/raspberrypi_contilab/pvenv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/cv2/qt/plugins" even though it was found.
This application failed to start because no Qt platform plugin could be initialized. Reinstalling the application may fix this problem.

Available platform plugins are: xcb.

GitHub Copilot: Here’s what’s happening based on your output and the README:

---

### **What the README says**
- You are following the correct steps for booting the TACHY-BS Shield and running the runtime API.
- The boot.py script uploads firmware components (spl, uboot, kernel, fpga) and signals the device to boot.
- After booting, you are getting successful status responses from the device.

---

### **Your Output Analysis**
- The boot process is working:  
  ```
  [INFO] Success to boot. Check the status via uart or other api
  Boot command completed
  (True, {'parameter': {'code': 0, ...}})
  ```
- However, at the end, you see:
  ```
  qt.qpa.xcb: could not connect to display 
  qt.qpa.plugin: Could not load the Qt platform plugin "xcb" ...
  This application failed to start because no Qt platform plugin could be initialized.
  ```

---

### **What does this error mean?**
- This is a **Qt/GUI error** from OpenCV (cv2), not from the Tachy API or boot process.
- It happens because something in your script (or a library it uses) is trying to open a GUI window (e.g., `cv2.imshow()`), but you are running in a terminal or SSH session **without an X11 display**.

---

### **How to fix or work around:**

1. **If you do not need GUI display:**
   - Make sure your code does not call `cv2.imshow()` or any OpenCV GUI functions.
   - If you want to save images, use `cv2.imwrite()` instead.

2. **If you need GUI display:**
   - Run your script on a machine with a graphical desktop environment.
   - Or, if using SSH, enable X11 forwarding:
     ```bash
     ssh -X user@raspberrypi
     ```
   - Make sure you have an X server running on your client machine (e.g., XQuartz on Mac, Xming on Windows).

3. **If you want to suppress OpenCV GUI:**
   - Comment out or remove any lines in your code that use `cv2.imshow`, `cv2.waitKey`, or similar.

---

**Summary:**  
Your boot process is working. The Qt error is unrelated to the device boot and is caused by OpenCV trying to open a GUI window in a non-GUI environment.

Let me know if you want help editing your script to avoid GUI calls, or if you want to set up X11 forwarding!

umraiz-ai: read this file and let me know what to do ?

GitHub Copilot: This file provides instructions for running an object detection example using YOLO (COCO 80 classes) with your setup.

### Here’s what you should do:

1. **Run the picture example script:**
   ```bash
   ./bin/picture.sh
   ```
   This will run object detection on a sample image.

2. **(Optional) Run the sensor example script:**
   ```bash
   ./bin/sensor.sh
   ```
   This will run object detection using a connected sensor (e.g., camera).

3. **To use your own image as input:**
   - Move or copy your image to the `image` directory with the naming format `input_<N>.<format>`, for example:
     ```bash
     mv myphoto.jpg ./image/input_1.jpg
     ```
   - Then re-run the picture example script.

**Note:**  
If you see any errors related to display (like before), it may be because the script tries to show images using a GUI. If you only want to save results, check if the script supports that or edit it to use `cv2.imwrite()` instead of `cv2.imshow()`.

Let me know if you want to proceed with a specific step or need help with the output!

umraiz-ai: (pvenv) root@raspberrypi:/home/admin/raspberrypi_contilab/inference/example/object_detection_yolo_coco-80cls# ./bin/picture.sh
bash: ./bin/picture.sh: Permission denied

GitHub Copilot: The error `Permission denied` means the script does not have execute permissions.

**To fix this, run:**
````bash
chmod +x ./bin/picture.sh
````

Then try running the script again:
````bash
./bin/picture.sh
````

umraiz-ai: what is inside this shell script and where its output is saved ?

GitHub Copilot: To know what is inside `./bin/picture.sh` and where its output is saved, you should:

1. **View the script contents**  
   Run:
   ````bash
   cat ./bin/picture.sh
   ````
   or open it in an editor:
   ````bash
   nano ./bin/picture.sh
   ````

2. **Check for output location**  
   - Look for lines in the script that use commands like `python`, `echo`, `cp`, `mv`, or `cv2.imwrite`.
   - The script may save results to a file or directory, often something like `./result_picture.png`, as referenced in the README.

**Summary:**  
- The script likely runs an inference on an image and saves the result as `result_picture.png` in the same directory.
- To confirm, inspect the script as shown above.

Would you like me to explain the script if you paste its contents here?

umraiz-ai: I want you to open this script. 

GitHub Copilot: I don’t have direct access to open files on your system, but you can easily view the contents of `./bin/picture.sh` by running:

````bash
cat ./bin/picture.sh
````

or

````bash
nano ./bin/picture.sh
````

If you paste the contents here, I can explain exactly what it does and where its output is saved.

umraiz-ai: (pvenv) root@raspberrypi:/home/admin/raspberrypi_contilab/inference/example/object_detection_yolo_coco-80cls# ./bin/sensor.sh
bash: ./bin/sensor.sh: Permission denied

GitHub Copilot: You are getting `Permission denied` because `./bin/sensor.sh` does not have execute permissions.

**To fix this:**

````bash
chmod +x ./bin/sensor.sh
````

Then run the script again:

````bash
./bin/sensor.sh
````

If you want to know what’s inside the script or where its output is saved, you can view it with:

````bash
cat ./bin/sensor.sh
````

Let me know if you want an explanation of the script after viewing its contents!

GitHub Copilot: This file, object_detection_pic.py, is a Python script for running object detection using a YOLO model on images with the Tachy-Runtime API. Here’s a breakdown of what it does:

---

### **Main Workflow**

1. **Argument Parsing**
   - Expects arguments for:
     - `--model`: Model name (required)
     - `--input_shape`: Input shape (HxWxD, required)
     - `--input_dir`: Directory containing input images (required)
     - `--upload_firmware`: Whether to upload firmware (default: true)
     - `--path_firmware`: Path to firmware (default provided)
   - Checks that the `TACHY_INTERFACE` environment variable is set.

2. **Image Preparation**
   - Loads all images matching `input*` in the specified input directory.
   - Resizes them to the specified input shape.

3. **Model and Device Setup**
   - Optionally uploads firmware to the device (functionality present but commented out in `main`).
   - Uploads the model to the device.
   - Creates and connects a runtime inference instance.

4. **Inference**
   - For each input image:
     - Runs inference using the Tachy device.
     - Applies post-processing to get detection results (bounding boxes and class labels).
     - Draws bounding boxes and class labels on the image.
     - Stores the result.

5. **Result Display**
   - Concatenates all input images and their predictions.
   - Saves the combined result as `result.png` in the current directory.
   - (No GUI display is used; only file output.)

---

### **Key Points**

- **No GUI Required:**  
  The script saves results to `result.png` and does not attempt to display them with `cv2.imshow()`, so it works in headless environments.

- **Output Location:**  
  The output image with detections is saved as `result.png` in the current working directory.

- **Customization:**  
  You can add your own images to the input directory (named as `input*`) and run the script to get detection results.

---

**Summary:**  
This script automates the process of running object detection on a batch of images using a YOLO model and the Tachy device, saving the annotated results to `result.png`.
